## Program RainDatav0.1

The set of programs is meant to organize Funceme's matrix-like daily rain data as a vector.

The steps are:
1. Download the wanted file in Funceme's website <http://www.funceme.br/?page_id=2694> or <http://www.funceme.br/produtos/script/chuvas/Download_de_series_historicas/DownloadChuvasPublico.php>

2. Import the data to Excel, delete the first 4 columns (Munic√≠pio, Posto, Lat, Long) and the first line (header)
 
3. Identify the DEFAUT value (a numerical value used in months with less than 31 days, usually negative integers)
 
4. Copy the data into a new .txt file; be sure to have no separators such as comma or semicolon (the separation has to be tabulation only!)
 
5. Execute RainData.f95
 
6. Bob's your uncle

If you want to have event-days only, execute RainDataClean.95
The input file is the output of the previous program
Easy peasy :D
